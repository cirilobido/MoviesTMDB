The main purpose of **Muvi App** is to obtain basic details of the movies. Using the **[TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)**  as the main source to display the data, Muvi provides the user with a simple and intuitive interface where they can enjoy the details of almost all the movies in history.

> **Note:** The **Muvi App** only shows basic details of the movies, it is **not** possible to **download or view** any content related to it except for the trailers.
